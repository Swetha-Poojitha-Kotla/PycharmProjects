#tuple -> same as list -> change values in tuples

tup = (21,34,5,6778,3555,999999)
print(tup)
print(tup[1])
#count -> number of times that element is present in tuple
print(tup.count(21))
#index of particular element
print(tup.index(21))
#iteration in tuple is faster than list there we can use


#set -> curly braces and doesnt follow any sequence
s = {1,34,5,6,6,7,77}
print(s)
#wont print duplicates
s2 = {1,1,1,1,3,4,5,6,6,7,7,8,9,9,3,3,4,3,34,}
print(s2)
#set doesnto support indexing because its not ordered
